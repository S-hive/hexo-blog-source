## 摘要

**Objective:** To identify how current pressure ulcer staging systems and experts describe pressure-related deep tissue injury under intact skin in the published research literature.  
目标：识别当前压力性溃疡分期系统及专家在已发表的科研文献中如何描述完整皮肤下的压力相关深层组织损伤。

**Design:** A systematic review of published English-language literature as of November 2002 with the words decubitus or pressure ulcer(s) in the title. Additional relevant articles were identified by National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel members and were included in the analysis. An expert commentary was developed by iterative review by the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel members.  
设计：对截至 2002 年 11 月的英文文献进行系统回顾，标题中包含褥疮或压力性溃疡（s）关键词。国家压力性溃疡咨询小组成员额外识别了相关文章，并将其纳入分析。国家压力性溃疡咨询小组成员通过迭代评审制定了专家评论。

**Main outcome measures:** Manuscripts were reviewed for staging systems cited or described, definitions of Stage I pressure ulcers, and descriptions or definitions of pressure-related deep tissue injury under intact skin.  
主要结果指标：审查文献中引用或描述的分期系统、I 期压力性溃疡的定义，以及完整皮肤下压力相关深层组织损伤的描述或定义。

**Main results:** Ninety-four relevant articles were identified. Seventy-three articles (78%) described a staging system, and 55 of 73 (75%) cited the staging definitions from Shea, the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, or the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel's staging definitions were the most frequently cited overall. Twenty-three articles (25%) included some discussion that could be interpreted as relevant to the topic of pressure-related deep tissue injury under intact skin; however, no consistency in definitions of Stage I pressure ulcers or terminology for pressure-related deep tissue injury under intact skin was found.  
主要结果：识别出 94 篇相关文献。其中 73 篇（78%）描述了分期系统，73 篇中的 55 篇（75%）引用了 Shea、国家压疮顾问小组或健康护理政策研究机构的分期定义。国家压疮顾问小组的分期定义是引用最频繁的。23 篇文献（25%）包含了一些可解释为与完整皮肤下压力相关深层组织损伤主题相关的讨论；然而，未发现 I 期压疮定义的一致性或完整皮肤下压力相关深层组织损伤的术语。

**Conclusions:** Several pressure ulcer staging systems are frequently cited, but none define pressure-related deep tissue injury under intact skin. The National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel recommends using the terms "pressure-related deep tissue injury under intact skin" or "deep tissue injury under intact skin" for describing these lesions and encourages investigators to establish the epidemiology and natural history of these lesions.  
结论：几种压疮分期系统被频繁引用，但没有定义完整皮肤下压力相关深层组织损伤。国家压疮顾问小组建议使用“完整皮肤下压力相关深层组织损伤”或“完整皮肤下深层组织损伤”这些术语来描述这些病变，并鼓励研究人员建立这些病变的流行病学和自然史。
