## Abstract   摘要

Our understanding of pressure injury etiology and development has grown in recent years through research, clinical expertise, and global interdisciplinary expert collaboration. Therefore, the National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) has revised the definition and stages of pressure injury. The revision was undertaken to incorporate the current understanding of the etiology of pressure injuries, as well as to clarify the anatomical features present or absent in each stage of injury. An NPUAP-appointed Task Force reviewed the literature and created drafts of definitions, which were then reviewed by stakeholders and the public, including clinicians, educators, and researchers around the world. Using a consensus-building methodology, these revised definitions were the focus of a multidisciplinary consensus conference held in April 2016. As a result of stakeholder and public input, along with the consensus conference, important changes were made and incorporated into the new staging definitions. The revised staging system uses the term injury instead of ulcer and denotes stages using Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. The revised definition of a pressure injury now describes the injuries as usually occurring over a bony prominence or under a medical or other device. The revised definition of a Stage 2 pressure injury seeks to clarify the difference between moisture-associated skin damage and injury caused by pressure and/or shear. The term suspected has been removed from the Deep Tissue Pressure Injury diagnostic label. Each definition now describes the extent of tissue loss present and the anatomical features that may or may not be present in the stage of injury. These important revisions reflect the methodical and collaborative approach used to examine the available evidence and incorporate current interdisciplinary clinical expertise into better defining the important phenomenon of pressure injury etiology and development.  
近年来，通过研究、临床专业知识和全球跨学科专家合作，我们对压力性损伤的病因和发展有了更深入的理解。因此，国家压力性损伤咨询小组（NPUAP）修订了压力性损伤的定义和分期。此次修订旨在纳入当前对压力性损伤病因的理解，并阐明损伤每个阶段存在或缺失的解剖特征。NPUAP 任命的任务组审查了文献并创建了定义草案，随后由利益相关者和公众进行审查，包括来自世界各地的临床医生、教育工作者和研究人员。采用共识建立方法，这些修订后的定义成为 2016 年 4 月举行的多学科共识会议的焦点。在利益相关者和公众的输入以及共识会议的结果下，重要变化被做出并纳入新的分期定义中。修订后的分期系统使用“损伤”一词代替“溃疡”，并使用阿拉伯数字而不是罗马数字来表示分期。 压力损伤的修订定义现描述损伤通常发生在骨突部位或医疗设备或其他装置下方。II 期压力损伤的修订定义旨在阐明潮湿相关性皮肤损伤与压力和/或剪切力引起的损伤之间的区别。在深部组织压力损伤的诊断标签中已删除"疑似"一词。每个定义现描述了损伤部位存在的组织缺损程度以及可能存在或不存在于该损伤阶段的解剖特征。这些重要修订反映了系统性和协作性的方法，用于审查现有证据并将当前跨学科临床专业知识纳入更好地定义压力损伤病因和发展的重要现象中
